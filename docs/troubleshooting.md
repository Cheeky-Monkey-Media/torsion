## npm install
In case you are having permission issues when running `npm install`, try the following alternative:

* **Linux / MacOS**: type: sudo npm install, then, type: bower install (in this case running bower install manually is necessary as sudo wonâ€™t run it)
* **Windows**: Open the command prompt as an administrator, then, type: npm install
