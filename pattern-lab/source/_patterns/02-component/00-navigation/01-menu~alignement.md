title: Item Alignement
---
By default, each item in the menu aligns to the left. They can also be aligned to the right with the `.align-right` class.

To align items in the middle, add a wrapping element with the class `.menu-centered`.

Items can also be set to expand out and take up an even amount of space, with the `.expanded` class. Thanks to the magic of CSS, the items will automatically size themselves equally depending on how many are inside the menu.
