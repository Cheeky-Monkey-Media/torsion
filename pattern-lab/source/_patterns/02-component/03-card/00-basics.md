A card is just an element with a `.card` class applied. You can put any kind of content inside. Make sure you wrap your content in a `.card-section` element in order to achieve the traditional card look.

A card container has no padding, allowing you to place full-bleed images inside. Use the `.card-divider` and `.card-section` classes to sub-divide a card.
